# Orbu

Welcome to <b>Orbu</b>! 
You are a witch doctor who desires power and fame; and I am your emotional-support beetle!
The only thing standing in our way is your goody-two-shoes paladin neighbor who always seems so <i>nice</i> and <i>caring</i>... <b>UGH</b>.
Why is she so... popular? Mana of course! We must find a way to take her mana and claim our rightful place at the throne!

Enjoy a unique multiplayer, card-based experience where you race an opponent to gain the most mana!

# Cards

Let's see what we have in our **spellbook**. Hmmm. Ah!
This seems like a good **spell** to show you!

(3 green mana, *potion*, Choose a mana well: gain 10 of that kind of mana)

(5 red mana, *charm - 5 turns*, Choose a mana well: Whenever you play a card, target well gains 3 mana)

This is a **potion** and a **charm**, two of many examples of spells!
Playing a potion generates an action immediately, while a charm takes some time to become effective.
They cost mana from a particular well and have some effect! They are both very strong.

(10 blue mana, *trap - Zip*, Destroy the next spell)

Wait... This is a weird spell. I don't believe I've ever seen it before...
It seems as if you can meddle with your opponent's plans. I... I LOVE IT.
I can't wait to crawl up in their brains! Hehehe

# Mana
As in most strategy games, resources are fuel for the running engine of play! 
In <b>Orbu</b>, mana is our *fuel* and *finish line*.
*Playing cards requires mana*, but didn't I say earlier that we wanted the most mana?
Hmmm... Seems like we're in somewhat of a predicament...
How do we know when to cast a spell? This is getting complicated...
I'm glad I'm just a beetle and not someone capable like you. And may I add that you're looking radiant today?

There are 4 kinds of mana that we use. They are stored in these mana wells at the bottom of your screen!

# Phases

We hate our neighbor, so of course we generate chaos and bring death and destruction upon them, right?
<b>WRONG</b>.
We are but cogs in this world, these rules have already been established and there's not much we can do to change them.
At least we get to formally embarass our enemies in the first place, right? Well, let's make the best of it.

In general, you prepare your spells simultaneously with your opponent, perform each one at a time, rinse our wands, and repeat the process.

## Selection Phase

So many spells in our arsenal! What to choose?
This is the only phase where we can interact with the board, so think carefully how you want to do that.

During this phase, we see boxes on the screen. Drag and drop spells from your hand onto the boxes to play them!
If a spell requires a target, we choose the targets now.

Remember that each spell has a cost associated with it. 
You may not be able to play all of your cards, or even worse, your enemy might beat you to their goal of getting the most mana!

In addition, *your spells will remember their order through future phases*, so be sure to queue them up in the order that you like.

## Zipping Phase

A **techromiter** will appear to take your order!

A techromiter is a heartless, unbiased machine which sees no difference between you, a handsome and celestial being, and me, a handsome and celestial beetle. Even that scum of an opponent is the same in the eyes of the techromiter.

Our spells will be zipped up with our opponent's spells in the order that we specified earlier. As the first players, our spells will be fed through the machine 1st, 3rd, 5th, ...
The enemy's spells will be fed through the machine 2nd, 4th, ...

## Execution Phase

Now is when we get to see the real fun! My tiny beetle heart is so excited!

When a spell is fed through the machine, it eats up as much mana as a card asked for, and performs the actions of the spell. 
If a spell can't be paid for, then it won't give us what we asked for. 
How unfortunate! Maybe we can devise a strategy to take... something from our opponent. I'd love to help you ruin their plans.

## Action Phase

The techromiter can modify our mana wells, but it is also a masterful crafter.
The techromiter might spit out a physical object, depending on the spell you put into it.

During the Action Phase, all objects on the board have an opportunity to perform their actions according to their purposes.

## End Phase

During this phase, we can refill the spells available to us by drawing spell cards from our spellbook.
Each End Phase, we get 3 more spells in our hand and 2 more mana in each mana well.
How exciting!

Now we go again until someone has filled up each of their mana wells all the way! How cool!
