# Orbu

Welcome to <b>Orbu</b>! 
You are a witch doctor who desires power and fame; and I am your emotional-support beetle!
The only thing standing in our way is your goody-two-shoes paladin neighbor who always seems so <i>nice</i> and <i>caring</i>... <b>UGH</b>.
Why is she so... popular? Mana of course! We must find a way to take her mana and claim our rightful place at the throne!

Enjoy a unique multiplayer, card-based experience where you race an opponent to gain the most mana!

# Cards

Let's see what we have in our <u>spellbook</u>. Hmmm. Ah!
This seems like a good <u>spell</u> to show you!

(3 green mana, <u>potion</u>, Choose a mana well: gain 10 of that kind of mana)
(5 red mana, <u>charm - 5 turns</u>, Choose a mana well: Whenever you play a card, target well gains 3 mana)

This is a <u>charm</u>, one of many examples of a spell!

# Mana
As in most strategy games, resources are fuel for the running engine of play! 
In <b>Orbu</b>, mana is our fuel and finish line.
<u>Playing cards requires mana</u>, but didn't I say earlier that we wanted the most mana?
Hmmm... Seems like we're in somewhat of a predicament...
How do we know when to cast a spell? This is getting complicated...

There are 4 kinds of mana that we use. They are stored in these mana wells at the bottom of your screen!
